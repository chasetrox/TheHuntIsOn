 * Footsteps.cs
 * 
 * This script places footsteps down on any surface whose layer is "Ground"
 * Attach this script to the player, provide the transform of a gameobject at the player's feet, and provide
 * the prefab to be instantiated. Also provide SFX for footsteps.
 * Also, to make water footsteps work, add a trigger collider to water and give it the tag "water"
 * Also, in edit->project settings->input make sure there is a button called "walk" I recommend shift as its button.
 * 
 * Sounds and prefab instantiation is determined by a displacement, so these are not networked.
 * What IS networked, however, is the "walk" state--if a player is holding the walk button,
 * they move slower, but provide no footprints or footstep sounds
